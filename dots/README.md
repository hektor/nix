# My dotfiles

To get started, run the following:

```
bash <(curl -s https://git.hektormisplon.xyz/hektor/dots/raw/branch/master/.bin/setup)
```

Note: will not set up *everything* (e.g. `/etc` configs, dependencies...), but
should get you up and running.

2025-10-04: I am migrating from Arch Linux to NixOS. For this transition, these
dotfiles are currently included as a subtree in my [NixOS repository](https://git.hektormisplon.xyz/hektor/nix).
